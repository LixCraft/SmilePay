# Bank Account Kata (EN)
_Une version [française est disponible](#bank-account-kata-fr)_
> This exercice has some flexible implementation and a deadline.  
> Its purpose is to provide a point of reference for the upcoming technical interview.  

## Instructions
The [MVP or Minimum Valuable Product](#mvp---minimum-valuable-product) is the mandatory part of the Kata. 
Yet, you can work on [bonus features](#bonus-features) to show off your skills.  
In case of missing information, make a choice and stay consistent with it.    
_Be careful with the size and the message of your commits._

**There is no "right" way to implement this Kata, we're interested in your choices and your technical skills within those constraints.**

### Delivery
The Kata should be delivered using a [Github](https://github.com) repository, or you can create a *Pull Request* to the [develop](https://github.com/kirinux/ing-bank-account-kata/tree/develop) branch of the [original repository](https://github.com/kirinux/ing-bank-account-kata).  
Your repository should have: 
* A branch named as your `trigram` received by mail ; it should contain your final source code.
* A `readme.md` file, explaining the possible details of your implementation and how to start your project.

### Technical constraints
* Java@8 minimum
* JUnit@5 + AssertJ@3
